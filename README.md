###### Title ########
Long‐Term Changes of Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) Con‐ ditions in the Pre‐Monsoon Season Over India

This project focuses on the study of climate indices over the Indian region.

This heat stress study on UTCI(universal thermal climate index), temp, relative humidity variables during the period of pre monsoon season analysis over India for the period 1990–2020.
--Below are the outputs and sample plots.

## Features
- This study examines heat stress through UTCI and explores its correlation with temperature and relative humidity.
1) To identify and evaluate heat stress hotspot regions across India.
2) To assess spatial and temporal trends in climatic variables over the Indian region.
3) To investigate the linear association between temperature and relative humidity.

- Spatial masking using shapefiles (India provinces)
- Python scripts for visualization and analysis
## Python Modules Requirements
- Python: xarray, matplotlib, netCDF4, numpy, shapely.geometry, geopandas, cartopy, cartopy cfeatures, datetime, metpy, scipy etc,

## Python Scripts

- remaing scripts written for case study and assesment, analysis, and Processes NetCDF files for variable conversions, generations, derivations and plots map.
